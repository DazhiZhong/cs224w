This document deals with which python version we use in openbook and why

We currently use python3
Specifially I use 3.5.2 on my machine but that is a technicality.

Why? 3 is better than 2 and and the 3 branch is mature stable and full of
stuff we want. 

Do we wish to enforce our selected version of python on the user?
- At the shbang line we dont. That is why the shbang lines are #!/usr/bin/python3
- We used to enforce by 'import check_version' which was a module that checked
the version in every script and I removed that. There is no reason to rely on
a specific version of python so this was removed.
