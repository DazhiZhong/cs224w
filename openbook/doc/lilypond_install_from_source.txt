- download the sources from:
	http://download.linuxaudio.org/lilypond/sources/v2.14/
- untar.
- ./configure --prefix=/local/tools
- install the missing packages.
	t2utils, texi2html, guide-1.8-dev and more.
- get to a situation where ./configure does not complain about anything.
- make all
- run make all a couple of times (the lilypond build system is not very clean).
- sudo make install

I have seen times when the version installed from source crashed on me in weird ways
and produced bad output. A better option seems to be to use the .sh installers provided
by the lilypond team.

you can ask for help via:
	./lilypond-2.14.2-1.linux-x86.sh --help
do:
	./lilypond-2.14.2-1.linux-x86.sh --prefix=/home/mark/install/lilypond-2.14.2
then:
	ln -s ~/install/lilypond-2.14.2/bin/lilypond ~/bin

Currently (01/12) I do manage to build openbook using the .sh package.
